# Connect-X-Competition
This is my project from Kaggle competition Connect X (https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx).

- File 'train_agent.ipynb' contains python code for creation, training and testing my agent.
- 'model_superagent_step_4_2' contains finall weights of the model.
- 'submission.py' represents agent as a single function with model weights.
- 'test_submission_file.ipynb' can be used for testing submission.py' and evaluation of agent performance.
